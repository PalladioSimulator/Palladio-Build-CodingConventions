This folder contains three files:

- SDQ_Code_Conventions.xml - is a checkstyle configuration file, 
that can be used to analyze style violations in source code with checkstyle.

- sdq_code_formatter.xml - is an Eclipse auto-formatter configuration 
that can be set for each project in Properties -> Java Code Style -> Formatter

- sdq_cleanup_rules.xml - is an Eclipse auto-cleanup configuration
that can be set for each project in Properties -> Java Code Style -> Cleanup

Both formatter and cleanup help to faster achieve checkstyle conventions.
