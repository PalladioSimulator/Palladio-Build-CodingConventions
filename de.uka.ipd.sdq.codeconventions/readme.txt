This folder contains three files:

- palladio-checkstyle-rules.xml - is a checkstyle configuration file, 
that can be used to analyze style violations in source code with checkstyle.

- palladio-code-formatter.xml - is an Eclipse auto-formatter configuration 
that can be set for each project in Properties -> Java Code Style -> Formatter

- palladio-cleanup-rules.xml - is an Eclipse auto-cleanup configuration
that can be set for each project in Properties -> Java Code Style -> Cleanup

Both formatter and cleanup help to faster achieve checkstyle conventions.
